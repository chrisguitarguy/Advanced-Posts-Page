Advanced post per page does not add a settings page. You can find all its options under `Settings > Reading`

Just set that archive's value to `0`

Set the archive's value to `-1`

Yes. Assuming you set `has_archive` to `true` when the post type we registered, the post type should show up in the options.  See the screenshots for an example.
